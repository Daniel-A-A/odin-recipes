# odin-recipes

Today is 21.11.2022 and I just completed my first project on TOP.

The project was a simple webpage in 100% HTML for recipes for dishes/food. It has a main index/homepage that links to 3 different dishes. All 3 have their own header, description, ingredients UL list and instructions OL list.

As I have dabbled in HTML before it wasn't the hardest thing in the world,
but I still felt like I benefited from doing it again.

I learnt that copying and pasting stuff something makes you mess up
your code, so it's wise to double check stuff.

I also learnt and did more of the git commit/add stuff with comments on the
built-in terminal on VSCode which I had set up from the tutorial.

All of my file and folder creation was done using the terminal and i'm proud of that. Pictures I had to screenshot and crop, though, and saved them in the
img folder.
